Jhaniv Privacy Policy Jhaniv LTD. (“we”, “us” or “Jhaniv”) respects your right
to privacy. Your ability to make informed choices about the use of your
information is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains our policy
regarding the collection, use, disclosure and protection of personal information
we receive. If not otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy, capitalized terms
have the meaning given to them in our Terms of Service, which you may read at
http://www.Jhaniv.com/terms.html (the “Terms”). Information We Collect “Personal
Information” means information that can be directly associated with a specific
person. If you use the Services by logging in through Facebook, we may receive
Personal Information about you as provided by Facebook. Please check Facebook’s
policies in order to understand what information we receive. We collect Personal
Information when you upload User Content, such as videos, photos and text. We
also collect Personal Information when you contact us for any reason. It is your
voluntary decision whether to provide us with any such Personal Information, but
if you refuse to provide such information we may not be able to register you to
use the Services or your use of the Services may be limited. In addition, when
you use the Services, certain information may be automatically gathered about
your computer, browser, operating system, geo-location, IP address or mobile
device. How we Protect Information We make efforts to follow generally accepted
industry standards to protect Personal Information, both during transmission and
once we receive it. However, you must realize that no method of transmission
over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, we
cannot guarantee its absolute security. We will delete any Personal Information
provided to us by a user upon the receipt of a written request by such user. We
cannot restore information that we have deleted. How we Use Information Except
as specifically set forth in these Terms, we will not share your Personal
Information with third parties without your explicit permission, except when
required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order, in order to protect our
rights or in order to cooperate with an investigation by a law enforcement body.
We may use Personal Information internally – for example, to help diagnose
problems with our servers, to make Jhaniv more useful, or to customize Jhaniv
and personalize its content for you. We let you post User Content, which may
include Personal Information, onto the feeds, chats, and forums available on the
Services. We may share your Personal Information with: • members of our
corporate family, or third party vendors or service providers, such as email
service providers sending emails on our behalf. We may also authorize third
party vendors or service providers to collect information on our behalf. We will
require members of our corporate family and third party vendors to follow
practices that protect your privacy rights on a level at least as restrictive as
the practices described in this Privacy Policy. • Business partners with whom we
may jointly offer products or services, or whose products or services may be
offered on our website. You can tell when a third party is involved in a product
or service because their name will appear, either alone or with ours. If you
choose to use these products or services, we may share information about you,
including your Personal Information, with those partners. Please note that we do
not control the privacy practices of these third party business partners. If you
wish to no longer allow that third party to use your information, please contact
that third party directly. • Referring websites. If you were referred to this
website from another site (for example, through a link), we may share some
information about you with that referring website. We encourage you to review
the privacy policies of any website that referred you here. Additionally, when
you link to one of our partners from our Services, we provide that partner with
a unique identifier so they know that you were referred from our Services. This
unique identifier will not contain any of your Personal Information. By
analyzing all information we receive, including all information concerning
users, we may compile statistical information across a variety of users
(“Statistical Information”). Statistical Information helps understand trends and
user needs so that new products and services can be considered and so existing
products and services can be tailored to user desires. Statistical Information
is does not indicate individuals’ identities, and we will not link Statistical
Information to any Personal Information. We may share Statistical Information
with our partners, without restriction, on commercial terms that we can
determine in our sole discretion. We also use a tool called “Google Analytics”
to collect information about the use of the Site and/or Services. Google
Analytics collects information such as how often users visit this Site, what
pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming
to this Site. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on
the date you visit this site, rather than your name or other identifying
information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of
Google Analytics with personally identifiable information. We use the
information we get from Google Analytics only to improve our Site and Services.
Google’s ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics
about your visits to this site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of
Use located at http://www.google.com/analytics/terms/us.html and the Google
Privacy Policy located at http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/. Communities

forums, or chat services, please remember that any information disclosed in
these venues may be automatically made public, even without your knowledge or

exercise caution when disclosing any information, including Personal
Information, in such venues, as you do not know who will access or use such
information and for what purposes. Jhaniv is in no way responsible for the
accuracy, use or misues of any information, including Personal Information,
which you disclose in such venues. Cookies A cookie is a small piece of text
that is sent to a visitor's browser. The browser provides this piece of text to
the device of the originating visitor when this visitor returns. We use cookies
to help personalize your Jhaniv experience. A “persistent” cookie may be used to
help save your settings and customizations. Also, if you log in to the
application that we may provide, such a cookie will be used to recognize you as
a valid user so you will not need to log in each time you use the application.
Most Web browsers are initially configured to accept cookies, but you can change
this setting so your browser either refuses all cookies or informs you when a
cookie is being sent. Also, you are free to delete any existing cookies at any
time. Please note that some features of the Services may not function properly
when cookies are disabled or removed. Online Links to Other Sites You can link
to other websites of third parties that provide useful information/services. Any
Personal Information you provide on the linked pages is provided directly to
this third party and is subject to this third party’s provider’s privacy policy.
Additionally, when you book vacation or other services through our partners or
through web sites linked by our partners, you share your Personal Information
directly with those third party web sites and their privacy policy governs the
collection and use of this information. We advise you check these privacy
policies. We do not have access to the information collected by those third
party web sites or by our partners. Except as described in this Privacy Policy,
we are not responsible for the content or privacy practices of third party web
sites to which we or our partners link. Use of Jhaniv by Children We do not
